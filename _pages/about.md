Short Bios
------
I am a post-graduate student at [School of Cyberscience and Engineering, Southeast University](https://cyber.seu.edu.cn/), advisor: [Prof. Fei Tong](https://cyber.seu.edu.cn/tf4/list.htm). I received my B. Eng. from [Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommuncation](http://www.njupt.edu.cn/) in 2021, advisor: [Prof. Jia Xu](https://xujia-njupt.github.io/xujia.github.io/). 

I shall obtain my Master's degree in 2024.6. **I am looking for a Ph.D. position in *Computer Science (CS)* or *Computer Engineering (CE)*.** Please drop me an email (zhouyh1999@gmail.com) if you have any interest. (2024.3)

I've included my [CV] (/files/Resume_YH Zhou.pdf) for your reference. (2024.3 update)
