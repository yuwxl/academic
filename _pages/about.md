Short Bios
------
I am a post-graduate student at [School of Cyberscience and Engineering, Southeast University](https://cyber.seu.edu.cn/), advisor: [Prof. Fei Tong](https://cyber.seu.edu.cn/tf4/list.htm). I received my B. Eng. from [Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommuncation](http://www.njupt.edu.cn/) in 2021, advisor: [Prof. Jia Xu](https://xujia-njupt.github.io/xujia.github.io/). 

**I am applying for Ph.D. in *Computer Science (CS)* or *Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)*.** Please drop me an email (zhouyh1999@gmail.com) if you have any interest.

欢迎方向相近的同学和老师一起交流合作
